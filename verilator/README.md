## Verilator Simulation code.


We create simulation of all the .sv files(except IP Cores) that we use in the
project. Install GTK-Wave and edit the Makefile to create the executables.

Always compile down with individual test files because that helps in keeping the 
process tightly integrated with the code.


As of now we can simulate Scheduler, VGA_LED and Buffer i.e the full suite.
